** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_step()], and [sqlite3_finalize()],
** that allows an application to run multiple statements of SQL
** without having to use a lot of C code.
**
** ^The sqlite3_exec() interface runs zero or more UTF-8 encoded,
** semicolon-separate SQL statements passed into its 2nd argument,
** in the context of the [database connection] passed in as its 1st
** argument.  ^If the callback function of the 3rd argument to
** sqlite3_exec() is not NULL, then it is invoked for each result row
** coming out of the evaluated SQL statements.  ^The 4th argument to
** sqlite3_exec() is relayed through to the 1st argument of each
** callback invocation.  ^If the callback pointer to sqlite3_exec()
** is NULL, then no callback is ever invoked and result rows are
** ignored.
**
** ^If an error occurs while evaluating the SQL statements passed into
** sqlite3_exec(), then execution of the current statement stops and
** subsequent statements are skipped.  ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite3_exec()
** is not NULL then any error message is written into memory obtained
** from [sqlite3_malloc()] and passed back through the 5th parameter.
** To avoid memory leaks, the application should invoke [sqlite3_free()]
** on error message strings returned through the 5th parameter of
** sqlite3_exec() after the error message string is no longer needed.
** ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite3_exec() is not NULL and no errors
** occur, then sqlite3_exec() sets the pointer in its 5th parameter to
** NULL before returning.
**
** ^If an sqlite3_exec() callback returns non-zero, the sqlite3_exec()
** routine returns SQLITE_ABORT without invoking the callback again and
** without running any subsequent SQL statements.
**
** ^The 2nd argument to the sqlite3_exec() callback function is the
** number of columns in the result.  ^The 3rd argument to the sqlite3_exec()
** callback is an array of pointers to strings obtained as if from
** [sqlite3_column_text()], one for each column.  ^If an element of a
** result row is NULL then the corresponding string pointer for the
** sqlite3_exec() callback is a NULL pointer.  ^The 4th argument to the
** sqlite3_exec() callback is an array of pointers to strings where each
** entry represents the name of corresponding result column as obtained
** from [sqlite3_column_name()].
**
** ^If the 2nd parameter to sqlite3_exec() is a NULL pointer, a pointer
** to an empty string, or a pointer that contains only whitespace and/or
** SQL comments, then no SQL statements are evaluated and the database
** is not changed.
**

** <li> The application must not modify the SQL statement text passed into
**      the 2nd parameter of sqlite3_exec() while sqlite3_exec() is running.
** <li> The application must not dereference the arrays or string pointers
**       passed as the 3rd and 4th callback parameters after it returns.

/*
** CAPI3REF: OS Interface File Virtual Methods Object
**
** Every file opened by the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method populates an
** [sqlite3_file] object (or, more commonly, a subclass of the
** [sqlite3_file] object) with a pointer to an instance of this object.
** This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
** against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
**
** If the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
** to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
** may be invoked even if the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] reported that it failed.  The
** only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]
** is for the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
** to NULL.
**
** The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
** [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
** The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
** flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
** and not its inode needs to be synced.
**
** The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE].
** </ul>
** xLock() upgrades the database file lock.  In other words, xLock() moves the
** database file lock in the direction NONE toward EXCLUSIVE. The argument to
** xLock() is always one of SHARED, RESERVED, PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE, never
** SQLITE_LOCK_NONE.  If the database file lock is already at or above the
** requested lock, then the call to xLock() is a no-op.
** xUnlock() downgrades the database file lock to either SHARED or NONE.
** If the lock is already at or below the requested lock state, then the call
** to xUnlock() is a no-op.
** The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
** either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
** PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns, via its output
** pointer parameter, true if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
**
** The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
** VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
** [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
** integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
** point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
** write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
** functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
** locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
** about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
** core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
** A [file control opcodes | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
** Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
** greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.  VFS implementations should
** return [SQLITE_NOTFOUND] for file control opcodes that they do not
** recognize.
**
** The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the
** device that underlies the file.  The sector size is the
** minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
** other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
** method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the
** underlying device:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC512]

/*
** CAPI3REF: Standard File Control Opcodes
** KEYWORDS: {file control opcodes} {file control opcode}
**
** These integer constants are opcodes for the xFileControl method
** of the [sqlite3_io_methods] object and for the [sqlite3_file_control()]
** interface.
**
** <ul>
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
** opcode causes the xFileControl method to write the current state of
** the lock (one of [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE], [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED], [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE])
** into an integer that the pArg argument points to.
** This capability is only available if SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE_DEBUG].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT] opcode is used by SQLite to give the VFS
** layer a hint of how large the database file will grow to be during the
** current transaction.  This hint is not guaranteed to be accurate but it
** is often close.  The underlying VFS might choose to preallocate database
** file space based on this hint in order to help writes to the database
** file run faster.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_LIMIT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_LIMIT] opcode is used by in-memory VFS that
** implements [sqlite3_deserialize()] to set an upper bound on the size
** of the in-memory database.  The argument is a pointer to a [sqlite3_int64].
** If the integer pointed to is negative, then it is filled in with the
** current limit.  Otherwise the limit is set to the larger of the value
** of the integer pointed to and the current database size.  The integer
** pointed to is set to the new limit.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE] opcode is used to request that the VFS
** extends and truncates the database file in chunks of a size specified
** by the user. The fourth argument to [sqlite3_file_control()] should
** point to an integer (type int) containing the new chunk-size to use
** for the nominated database. Allocating database file space in large
** chunks (say 1MB at a time), may reduce file-system fragmentation and
** improve performance on some systems.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER] opcode is used to obtain a pointer
** to the [sqlite3_file] object associated with a particular database
** connection.  See also [SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER] opcode is used to obtain a pointer
** to the [sqlite3_file] object associated with the journal file (either
** the [rollback journal] or the [write-ahead log]) for a particular database
** connection.  See also [SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC_OMITTED]]
** No longer in use.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC] opcode is generated internally by SQLite and
** sent to the VFS immediately before the xSync method is invoked on a
** database file descriptor. Or, if the xSync method is not invoked
** because the user has configured SQLite with
** [PRAGMA synchronous | PRAGMA synchronous=OFF] it is invoked in place
** of the xSync method. In most cases, the pointer argument passed with
** this file-control is NULL. However, if the database file is being synced
** as part of a multi-database commit, the argument points to a nul-terminated
** string containing the transactions super-journal file name. VFSes that
** do not need this signal should silently ignore this opcode. Applications
** should not call [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may
** disrupt the operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO] opcode is generated internally by SQLite
** and sent to the VFS after a transaction has been committed immediately
** but before the database is unlocked. VFSes that do not need this signal
** should silently ignore this opcode. Applications should not call
** [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may disrupt the
** operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY] opcode is used to configure automatic
** retry counts and intervals for certain disk I/O operations for the
** windows [VFS] in order to provide robustness in the presence of
** anti-virus programs.  By default, the windows VFS will retry file read,
** file write, and file delete operations up to 10 times, with a delay
** of 25 milliseconds before the first retry and with the delay increasing
** by an additional 25 milliseconds with each subsequent retry.  This
** opcode allows these two values (10 retries and 25 milliseconds of delay)
** to be adjusted.  The values are changed for all database connections
** within the same process.  The argument is a pointer to an array of two
** integers where the first integer is the new retry count and the second
** integer is the delay.  If either integer is negative, then the setting
** is not changed but instead the prior value of that setting is written
** into the array entry, allowing the current retry settings to be
** interrogated.  The zDbName parameter is ignored.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL] opcode is used to set or query the
** persistent [WAL | Write Ahead Log] setting.  By default, the auxiliary
** write ahead log ([WAL file]) and shared memory
** files used for transaction control
** are automatically deleted when the latest connection to the database
** closes.  Setting persistent WAL mode causes those files to persist after
** close.  Persisting the files is useful when other processes that do not
** have write permission on the directory containing the database file want
** to read the database file, as the WAL and shared memory files must exist
** in order for the database to be readable.  The fourth parameter to
** [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
** That integer is 0 to disable persistent WAL mode or 1 to enable persistent
** WAL mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
** WAL persistence setting.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] opcode is used to set or query the
** persistent "powersafe-overwrite" or "PSOW" setting.  The PSOW setting
** determines the [SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] bit of the
** xDeviceCharacteristics methods. The fourth parameter to
** [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
** That integer is 0 to disable zero-damage mode or 1 to enable zero-damage
** mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
** zero-damage mode setting.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE] opcode is invoked by SQLite after opening
** a write transaction to indicate that, unless it is rolled back for some
** reason, the entire database file will be overwritten by the current
** transaction. This is used by VACUUM operations.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME] opcode can be used to obtain the names of
** all [VFSes] in the VFS stack.  The names are of all VFS shims and the
** final bottom-level VFS are written into memory obtained from
** [sqlite3_malloc()] and the result is stored in the char* variable
** that the fourth parameter of [sqlite3_file_control()] points to.
** The caller is responsible for freeing the memory when done.  As with
** all file-control actions, there is no guarantee that this will actually
** do anything.  Callers should initialize the char* variable to a NULL
** pointer in case this file-control is not implemented.  This file-control
** is intended for diagnostic use only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER] opcode finds a pointer to the top-level
** [VFSes] currently in use.  ^(The argument X in
** sqlite3_file_control(db,SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER,X) must be
** of type "[sqlite3_vfs] **".  This opcodes will set *X
** to a pointer to the top-level VFS.)^
** ^When there are multiple VFS shims in the stack, this opcode finds the
** upper-most shim only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]]
** ^Whenever a [PRAGMA] statement is parsed, an [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control is sent to the open [sqlite3_file] object corresponding
** to the database file to which the pragma statement refers. ^The argument
** to the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control is an array of
** pointers to strings (char**) in which the second element of the array
** is the name of the pragma and the third element is the argument to the
** pragma or NULL if the pragma has no argument.  ^The handler for an
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control can optionally make the first element
** of the char** argument point to a string obtained from [sqlite3_mprintf()]
** or the equivalent and that string will become the result of the pragma or
** the error message if the pragma fails. ^If the
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], then normal
** [PRAGMA] processing continues.  ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control returns [SQLITE_OK], then the parser assumes that the
** VFS has handled the PRAGMA itself and the parser generates a no-op
** prepared statement if result string is NULL, or that returns a copy
** of the result string if the string is non-NULL.
** ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns
** any result code other than [SQLITE_OK] or [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], that means
** that the VFS encountered an error while handling the [PRAGMA] and the
** compilation of the PRAGMA fails with an error.  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control occurs at the beginning of pragma statement analysis and so
** it is able to override built-in [PRAGMA] statements.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]
** file-control may be invoked by SQLite on the database file handle
** shortly after it is opened in order to provide a custom VFS with access
** to the connection's busy-handler callback. The argument is of type (void**)
** - an array of two (void *) values. The first (void *) actually points
** to a function of type (int (*)(void *)). In order to invoke the connection's
** busy-handler, this function should be invoked with the second (void *) in
** the array as the only argument. If it returns non-zero, then the operation
** should be retried. If it returns zero, the custom VFS should abandon the
** current operation.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME]]
** ^Applications can invoke the [SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME] file-control
** to have SQLite generate a
** temporary filename using the same algorithm that is followed to generate
** temporary filenames for TEMP tables and other internal uses.  The
** argument should be a char** which will be filled with the filename
** written into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].  The caller should
** invoke [sqlite3_free()] on the result to avoid a memory leak.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_MMAP_SIZE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_MMAP_SIZE] file control is used to query or set the
** maximum number of bytes that will be used for memory-mapped I/O.
** The argument is a pointer to a value of type sqlite3_int64 that
** is an advisory maximum number of bytes in the file to memory map.  The
** pointer is overwritten with the old value.  The limit is not changed if
** the value originally pointed to is negative, and so the current limit
** can be queried by passing in a pointer to a negative number.  This
** file-control is used internally to implement [PRAGMA mmap_size].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TRACE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_TRACE] file control provides advisory information
** to the VFS about what the higher layers of the SQLite stack are doing.
** This file control is used by some VFS activity tracing [shims].
** The argument is a zero-terminated string.  Higher layers in the
** SQLite stack may generate instances of this file control if
** the [SQLITE_USE_FCNTL_TRACE] compile-time option is enabled.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED] file control interprets its argument as a
** pointer to an integer and it writes a boolean into that integer depending
** on whether or not the file has been renamed, moved, or deleted since it
** was first opened.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_GET_HANDLE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_GET_HANDLE] opcode can be used to obtain the
** underlying native file handle associated with a file handle.  This file
** control interprets its argument as a pointer to a native file handle and
** writes the resulting value there.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_SET_HANDLE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_SET_HANDLE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
** opcode causes the xFileControl method to swap the file handle with the one
** pointed to by the pArg argument.  This capability is used during testing
** and only needs to be supported when SQLITE_TEST is defined.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WAL_BLOCK]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WAL_BLOCK] is a signal to the VFS layer that it might
** be advantageous to block on the next WAL lock if the lock is not immediately
** available.  The WAL subsystem issues this signal during rare
** circumstances in order to fix a problem with priority inversion.
** Applications should <em>not</em> use this file-control.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_ZIPVFS]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_ZIPVFS] opcode is implemented by zipvfs only. All other
** VFS should return SQLITE_NOTFOUND for this opcode.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_RBU]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_RBU] opcode is implemented by the special VFS used by
** the RBU extension only.  All other VFS should return SQLITE_NOTFOUND for
** this opcode.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE]]
** If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] opcode returns SQLITE_OK, then
** the file descriptor is placed in "batch write mode", which
** means all subsequent write operations will be deferred and done
** atomically at the next [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE].  Systems
** that do not support batch atomic writes will return SQLITE_NOTFOUND.
** ^Following a successful SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE and prior to
** the closing [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE] or
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE], SQLite will make
** no VFS interface calls on the same [sqlite3_file] file descriptor
** except for calls to the xWrite method and the xFileControl method
** with [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE] opcode causes all write
** operations since the previous successful call to
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] to be performed atomically.
** This file control returns [SQLITE_OK] if and only if the writes were
** all performed successfully and have been committed to persistent storage.
** ^Regardless of whether or not it is successful, this file control takes
** the file descriptor out of batch write mode so that all subsequent
** write operations are independent.
** ^SQLite will never invoke SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE without
** a prior successful call to [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE] opcode causes all write
** operations since the previous successful call to
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] to be rolled back.
** ^This file control takes the file descriptor out of batch write mode
** so that all subsequent write operations are independent.
** ^SQLite will never invoke SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE without
** a prior successful call to [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCK_TIMEOUT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCK_TIMEOUT] opcode is used to configure a VFS
** to block for up to M milliseconds before failing when attempting to
** obtain a file lock using the xLock or xShmLock methods of the VFS.
** The parameter is a pointer to a 32-bit signed integer that contains
** the value that M is to be set to. Before returning, the 32-bit signed
** integer is overwritten with the previous value of M.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_DATA_VERSION]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_DATA_VERSION] opcode is used to detect changes to
** a database file.  The argument is a pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer.
** The "data version" for the pager is written into the pointer.  The
** "data version" changes whenever any change occurs to the corresponding
** database file, either through SQL statements on the same database
** connection or through transactions committed by separate database
** connections possibly in other processes. The [sqlite3_total_changes()]
** interface can be used to find if any database on the connection has changed,
** but that interface responds to changes on TEMP as well as MAIN and does
** not provide a mechanism to detect changes to MAIN only.  Also, the
** [sqlite3_total_changes()] interface responds to internal changes only and
** omits changes made by other database connections.  The
** [PRAGMA data_version] command provides a mechanism to detect changes to
** a single attached database that occur due to other database connections,
** but omits changes implemented by the database connection on which it is
** called.  This file control is the only mechanism to detect changes that
** happen either internally or externally and that are associated with
** a particular attached database.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_START]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_START] opcode is invoked from within a checkpoint
** in wal mode before the client starts to copy pages from the wal
** file to the database file.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_DONE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_DONE] opcode is invoked from within a checkpoint
** in wal mode after the client has finished copying pages from the wal
** file to the database file, but before the *-shm file is updated to
** record the fact that the pages have been checkpointed.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_EXTERNAL_READER]]
** The EXPERIMENTAL [SQLITE_FCNTL_EXTERNAL_READER] opcode is used to detect
** whether or not there is a database client in another process with a wal-mode
** transaction open on the database or not. It is only available on unix.The
** (void*) argument passed with this file-control should be a pointer to a
** value of type (int). The integer value is set to 1 if the database is a wal
** mode database and there exists at least one client in another process that
** currently has an SQL transaction open on the database. It is set to 0 if
** the database is not a wal-mode db, or if there is no such connection in any
** other process. This opcode cannot be used to detect transactions opened
** by clients within the current process, only within other processes.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CKSM_FILE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CKSM_FILE] opcode is for use internally by the
** [checksum VFS shim] only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_RESET_CACHE]]
** If there is currently no transaction open on the database, and the
** database is not a temp db, then the [SQLITE_FCNTL_RESET_CACHE] file-control
** purges the contents of the in-memory page cache. If there is an open
** transaction, or if the db is a temp-db, this opcode is a no-op, not an error.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Dynamically Typed Value Object
** KEYWORDS: {protected sqlite3_value} {unprotected sqlite3_value}
**
** SQLite uses the sqlite3_value object to represent all values
** that can be stored in a database table. SQLite uses dynamic typing
** for the values it stores.  ^Values stored in sqlite3_value objects
** can be integers, floating point values, strings, BLOBs, or NULL.
**
** An sqlite3_value object may be either "protected" or "unprotected".
** Some interfaces require a protected sqlite3_value.  Other interfaces
** will accept either a protected or an unprotected sqlite3_value.
** Every interface that accepts sqlite3_value arguments specifies
** whether or not it requires a protected sqlite3_value.  The
** [sqlite3_value_dup()] interface can be used to construct a new
** protected sqlite3_value from an unprotected sqlite3_value.
**
** The terms "protected" and "unprotected" refer to whether or not
** a mutex is held.  An internal mutex is held for a protected
** sqlite3_value object but no mutex is held for an unprotected
** sqlite3_value object.  If SQLite is compiled to be single-threaded
** (with [SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0] and with [sqlite3_threadsafe()] returning 0)
** or if SQLite is run in one of reduced mutex modes
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_SINGLETHREAD] or [SQLITE_CONFIG_MULTITHREAD]
** then there is no distinction between protected and unprotected
** sqlite3_value objects and they can be used interchangeably.  However,
** for maximum code portability it is recommended that applications
** still make the distinction between protected and unprotected
** sqlite3_value objects even when not strictly required.
**
** ^The sqlite3_value objects that are passed as parameters into the
** implementation of [application-defined SQL functions] are protected.
** ^The sqlite3_value objects returned by [sqlite3_vtab_rhs_value()]
** are protected.
** ^The sqlite3_value object returned by
** [sqlite3_column_value()] is unprotected.
** Unprotected sqlite3_value objects may only be used as arguments
** to [sqlite3_result_value()], [sqlite3_bind_value()], and
** [sqlite3_value_dup()].
** The [sqlite3_value_blob | sqlite3_value_type()] family of

** EXTENSION API FUNCTIONS
**
** xUserData(pFts):
**   Return a copy of the pUserData pointer passed to the xCreateFunction()
**   API when the extension function was registered.
**
** xColumnTotalSize(pFts, iCol, pnToken):
**   If parameter iCol is less than zero, set output variable *pnToken
**   to the total number of tokens in the FTS5 table. Or, if iCol is
**   non-negative but less than the number of columns in the table, return
**   the total number of tokens in column iCol, considering all rows in
**   the FTS5 table.
**
**   If parameter iCol is greater than or equal to the number of columns
**   in the table, SQLITE_RANGE is returned. Or, if an error occurs (e.g.
**   an OOM condition or IO error), an appropriate SQLite error code is
**   returned.
**
** xColumnCount(pFts):
**   Return the number of columns in the table.
**
** xColumnSize(pFts, iCol, pnToken):
**   If parameter iCol is less than zero, set output variable *pnToken
**   to the total number of tokens in the current row. Or, if iCol is
**   non-negative but less than the number of columns in the table, set
**   *pnToken to the number of tokens in column iCol of the current row.
**
**   If parameter iCol is greater than or equal to the number of columns
**   in the table, SQLITE_RANGE is returned. Or, if an error occurs (e.g.
**   an OOM condition or IO error), an appropriate SQLite error code is
**   returned.
**
**   This function may be quite inefficient if used with an FTS5 table
**   created with the "columnsize=0" option.
**
** xColumnText:
**   If parameter iCol is less than zero, or greater than or equal to the
**   number of columns in the table, SQLITE_RANGE is returned.
**
**   Otherwise, this function attempts to retrieve the text of column iCol of
**   the current document. If successful, (*pz) is set to point to a buffer
**   containing the text in utf-8 encoding, (*pn) is set to the size in bytes
**   (not characters) of the buffer and SQLITE_OK is returned. Otherwise,
**   if an error occurs, an SQLite error code is returned and the final values
**   of (*pz) and (*pn) are undefined.
**
** xPhraseCount:
**   Returns the number of phrases in the current query expression.
**
** xPhraseSize:
**   If parameter iCol is less than zero, or greater than or equal to the
**   number of phrases in the current query, as returned by xPhraseCount,
**   0 is returned. Otherwise, this function returns the number of tokens in
**   phrase iPhrase of the query. Phrases are numbered starting from zero.
**
** xInstCount:
**   Set *pnInst to the total number of occurrences of all phrases within
**   the query within the current row. Return SQLITE_OK if successful, or
**   an error code (i.e. SQLITE_NOMEM) if an error occurs.
**
**   This API can be quite slow if used with an FTS5 table created with the
**   "detail=none" or "detail=column" option. If the FTS5 table is created
**   with either "detail=none" or "detail=column" and "content=" option
**   (i.e. if it is a contentless table), then this API always returns 0.
**
** xInst:
**   Query for the details of phrase match iIdx within the current row.
**   Phrase matches are numbered starting from zero, so the iIdx argument
**   should be greater than or equal to zero and smaller than the value
**   output by xInstCount(). If iIdx is less than zero or greater than
**   or equal to the value returned by xInstCount(), SQLITE_RANGE is returned.
**
**   Otherwise, output parameter *piPhrase is set to the phrase number, *piCol
**   to the column in which it occurs and *piOff the token offset of the
**   first token of the phrase. SQLITE_OK is returned if successful, or an
**   error code (i.e. SQLITE_NOMEM) if an error occurs.
**
**   This API can be quite slow if used with an FTS5 table created with the
**   "detail=none" or "detail=column" option.
**
** xRowid:
**   Returns the rowid of the current row.
**
** xTokenize:
**   Tokenize text using the tokenizer belonging to the FTS5 table.
**
** xQueryPhrase(pFts5, iPhrase, pUserData, xCallback):
**   This API function is used to query the FTS table for phrase iPhrase
**   of the current query. Specifically, a query equivalent to:
**
**       ... FROM ftstable WHERE ftstable MATCH $p ORDER BY rowid
**
**   with $p set to a phrase equivalent to the phrase iPhrase of the
**   current query is executed. Any column filter that applies to
**   phrase iPhrase of the current query is included in $p. For each
**   row visited, the callback function passed as the fourth argument
**   is invoked. The context and API objects passed to the callback
**   function may be used to access the properties of each matched row.
**   Invoking Api.xUserData() returns a copy of the pointer passed as
**   the third argument to pUserData.
**
**   If parameter iPhrase is less than zero, or greater than or equal to
**   the number of phrases in the query, as returned by xPhraseCount(),
**   this function returns SQLITE_RANGE.
**
**   If the callback function returns any value other than SQLITE_OK, the
**   query is abandoned and the xQueryPhrase function returns immediately.
**   If the returned value is SQLITE_DONE, xQueryPhrase returns SQLITE_OK.
**   Otherwise, the error code is propagated upwards.
**
**   If the query runs to completion without incident, SQLITE_OK is returned.
**   Or, if some error occurs before the query completes or is aborted by
**   the callback, an SQLite error code is returned.
**
**
** xSetAuxdata(pFts5, pAux, xDelete)
**
**   Save the pointer passed as the second argument as the extension function's
**   "auxiliary data". The pointer may then be retrieved by the current or any
**   future invocation of the same fts5 extension function made as part of
**   the same MATCH query using the xGetAuxdata() API.
**
**   Each extension function is allocated a single auxiliary data slot for
**   each FTS query (MATCH expression). If the extension function is invoked
**   more than once for a single FTS query, then all invocations share a
**   single auxiliary data context.
**
**   If there is already an auxiliary data pointer when this function is
**   invoked, then it is replaced by the new pointer. If an xDelete callback
**   was specified along with the original pointer, it is invoked at this
**   point.
**
**   The xDelete callback, if one is specified, is also invoked on the
**   auxiliary data pointer after the FTS5 query has finished.
**
**   If an error (e.g. an OOM condition) occurs within this function,
**   the auxiliary data is set to NULL and an error code returned. If the
**   xDelete parameter was not NULL, it is invoked on the auxiliary data
**   pointer before returning.
**
**
** xGetAuxdata(pFts5, bClear)
**
**   Returns the current auxiliary data pointer for the fts5 extension
**   function. See the xSetAuxdata() method for details.
**
**   If the bClear argument is non-zero, then the auxiliary data is cleared
**   (set to NULL) before this function returns. In this case the xDelete,
**   if any, is not invoked.
**
**
** xRowCount(pFts5, pnRow)
**
**   This function is used to retrieve the total number of rows in the table.
**   In other words, the same value that would be returned by:
**
**        SELECT count(*) FROM ftstable;
**
** xPhraseFirst()
**   This function is used, along with type Fts5PhraseIter and the xPhraseNext
**   method, to iterate through all instances of a single query phrase within
**   the current row. This is the same information as is accessible via the
**   xInstCount/xInst APIs. While the xInstCount/xInst APIs are more convenient
**   to use, this API may be faster under some circumstances. To iterate
**   through instances of phrase iPhrase, use the following code:
**
**       Fts5PhraseIter iter;
**       int iCol, iOff;
**       for(pApi->xPhraseFirst(pFts, iPhrase, &iter, &iCol, &iOff);
**           iCol>=0;
**           pApi->xPhraseNext(pFts, &iter, &iCol, &iOff)
**       ){
**         // An instance of phrase iPhrase at offset iOff of column iCol
**       }
**
**   The Fts5PhraseIter structure is defined above. Applications should not
**   modify this structure directly - it should only be used as shown above
**   with the xPhraseFirst() and xPhraseNext() API methods (and by
**   xPhraseFirstColumn() and xPhraseNextColumn() as illustrated below).
**
**   This API can be quite slow if used with an FTS5 table created with the
**   "detail=none" or "detail=column" option. If the FTS5 table is created
**   with either "detail=none" or "detail=column" and "content=" option
**   (i.e. if it is a contentless table), then this API always iterates
**   through an empty set (all calls to xPhraseFirst() set iCol to -1).
**
**   In all cases, matches are visited in (column ASC, offset ASC) order.
**   i.e. all those in column 0, sorted by offset, followed by those in
**   column 1, etc.
**
** xPhraseNext()
**   See xPhraseFirst above.
**
** xPhraseFirstColumn()
**   This function and xPhraseNextColumn() are similar to the xPhraseFirst()
**   and xPhraseNext() APIs described above. The difference is that instead
**   of iterating through all instances of a phrase in the current row, these
**   APIs are used to iterate through the set of columns in the current row
**   that contain one or more instances of a specified phrase. For example:
**
**       Fts5PhraseIter iter;
**       int iCol;
**       for(pApi->xPhraseFirstColumn(pFts, iPhrase, &iter, &iCol);
**           iCol>=0;
**           pApi->xPhraseNextColumn(pFts, &iter, &iCol)
**       ){
**         // Column iCol contains at least one instance of phrase iPhrase
**       }
**
**   This API can be quite slow if used with an FTS5 table created with the
**   "detail=none" option. If the FTS5 table is created with either
**   "detail=none" "content=" option (i.e. if it is a contentless table),
**   then this API always iterates through an empty set (all calls to
**   xPhraseFirstColumn() set iCol to -1).
**
**   The information accessed using this API and its companion
**   xPhraseFirstColumn() may also be obtained using xPhraseFirst/xPhraseNext
**   (or xInst/xInstCount). The chief advantage of this API is that it is
**   significantly more efficient than those alternatives when used with
**   "detail=column" tables.
**
** xPhraseNextColumn()
**   See xPhraseFirstColumn above.
**
** xQueryToken(pFts5, iPhrase, iToken, ppToken, pnToken)
**   This is used to access token iToken of phrase iPhrase of the current
**   query. Before returning, output parameter *ppToken is set to point
**   to a buffer containing the requested token, and *pnToken to the
**   size of this buffer in bytes.
**
**   If iPhrase or iToken are less than zero, or if iPhrase is greater than
**   or equal to the number of phrases in the query as reported by
**   xPhraseCount(), or if iToken is equal to or greater than the number of
**   tokens in the phrase, SQLITE_RANGE is returned and *ppToken and *pnToken
     are both zeroed.
**
**   The output text is not a copy of the query text that specified the
**   token. It is the output of the tokenizer module. For tokendata=1
**   tables, this includes any embedded 0x00 and trailing data.
**
** xInstToken(pFts5, iIdx, iToken, ppToken, pnToken)
**   This is used to access token iToken of phrase hit iIdx within the
**   current row. If iIdx is less than zero or greater than or equal to the
**   value returned by xInstCount(), SQLITE_RANGE is returned.  Otherwise,
**   output variable (*ppToken) is set to point to a buffer containing the
**   matching document token, and (*pnToken) to the size of that buffer in
**   bytes. This API is not available if the specified token matches a
**   prefix query term. In that case both output variables are always set
**   to 0.
**
**   The output text is not a copy of the document text that was tokenized.
**   It is the output of the tokenizer module. For tokendata=1 tables, this
**   includes any embedded 0x00 and trailing data.
**
**   This API can be quite slow if used with an FTS5 table created with the
**   "detail=none" or "detail=column" option.
**
** xColumnLocale(pFts5, iIdx, pzLocale, pnLocale)
**   If parameter iCol is less than zero, or greater than or equal to the
**   number of columns in the table, SQLITE_RANGE is returned.
**
**   Otherwise, this function attempts to retrieve the locale associated
**   with column iCol of the current row. Usually, there is no associated
**   locale, and output parameters (*pzLocale) and (*pnLocale) are set
**   to NULL and 0, respectively. However, if the fts5_locale() function
**   was used to associate a locale with the value when it was inserted
**   into the fts5 table, then (*pzLocale) is set to point to a nul-terminated
**   buffer containing the name of the locale in utf-8 encoding. (*pnLocale)
**   is set to the size in bytes of the buffer, not including the
**   nul-terminator.
**
**   If successful, SQLITE_OK is returned. Or, if an error occurs, an
**   SQLite error code is returned. The final value of the output parameters
**   is undefined in this case.
**
** xTokenize_v2:
**   Tokenize text using the tokenizer belonging to the FTS5 table. This
**   API is the same as the xTokenize() API, except that it allows a tokenizer
**   locale to be specified.

/*
** CUSTOM AUXILIARY FUNCTIONS
*************************************************************************/

/*************************************************************************
** CUSTOM TOKENIZERS
**
** Applications may also register custom tokenizer types. A tokenizer
** is registered by providing fts5 with a populated instance of the
** following structure. All structure methods must be defined, setting
** any member of the fts5_tokenizer struct to NULL leads to undefined
** behaviour. The structure methods are expected to function as follows:
**
** xCreate:
**   This function is used to allocate and initialize a tokenizer instance.
**   A tokenizer instance is required to actually tokenize text.
**
**   The first argument passed to this function is a copy of the (void*)
**   pointer provided by the application when the fts5_tokenizer_v2 object
**   was registered with FTS5 (the third argument to xCreateTokenizer()).
**   The second and third arguments are an array of nul-terminated strings
**   containing the tokenizer arguments, if any, specified following the
**   tokenizer name as part of the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement used
**   to create the FTS5 table.
**
**   The final argument is an output variable. If successful, (*ppOut)
**   should be set to point to the new tokenizer handle and SQLITE_OK
**   returned. If an error occurs, some value other than SQLITE_OK should
**   be returned. In this case, fts5 assumes that the final value of *ppOut
**   is undefined.
**
** xDelete:
**   This function is invoked to delete a tokenizer handle previously
**   allocated using xCreate(). Fts5 guarantees that this function will
**   be invoked exactly once for each successful call to xCreate().
**
** xTokenize:
**   This function is expected to tokenize the nText byte string indicated
**   by argument pText. pText may or may not be nul-terminated. The first
**   argument passed to this function is a pointer to an Fts5Tokenizer object
**   returned by an earlier call to xCreate().
**
**   The third argument indicates the reason that FTS5 is requesting
**   tokenization of the supplied text. This is always one of the following
**   four values:
**
**   <ul><li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_DOCUMENT</b> - A document is being inserted into
**            or removed from the FTS table. The tokenizer is being invoked to
**            determine the set of tokens to add to (or delete from) the
**            FTS index.
**
**       <li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY</b> - A MATCH query is being executed
**            against the FTS index. The tokenizer is being called to tokenize
**            a bareword or quoted string specified as part of the query.
**
**       <li> <b>(FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY | FTS5_TOKENIZE_PREFIX)</b> - Same as
**            FTS5_TOKENIZE_QUERY, except that the bareword or quoted string is
**            followed by a "*" character, indicating that the last token
**            returned by the tokenizer will be treated as a token prefix.
**
**       <li> <b>FTS5_TOKENIZE_AUX</b> - The tokenizer is being invoked to
**            satisfy an fts5_api.xTokenize() request made by an auxiliary
**            function. Or an fts5_api.xColumnSize() request made by the same
**            on a columnsize=0 database.
**   </ul>
**
**   The sixth and seventh arguments passed to xTokenize() - pLocale and
**   nLocale - are a pointer to a buffer containing the locale to use for
**   tokenization (e.g. "en_US") and its size in bytes, respectively. The
**   pLocale buffer is not nul-terminated. pLocale may be passed NULL (in
**   which case nLocale is always 0) to indicate that the tokenizer should
**   use its default locale.
**
**   For each token in the input string, the supplied callback xToken() must
**   be invoked. The first argument to it should be a copy of the pointer
**   passed as the second argument to xTokenize(). The third and fourth
**   arguments are a pointer to a buffer containing the token text, and the
**   size of the token in bytes. The 4th and 5th arguments are the byte offsets
**   of the first byte of and first byte immediately following the text from
**   which the token is derived within the input.
**
**   The second argument passed to the xToken() callback ("tflags") should
**   normally be set to 0. The exception is if the tokenizer supports
**   synonyms. In this case see the discussion below for details.
**
**   FTS5 assumes the xToken() callback is invoked for each token in the
**   order that they occur within the input text.
**
**   If an xToken() callback returns any value other than SQLITE_OK, then
**   the tokenization should be abandoned and the xTokenize() method should
**   immediately return a copy of the xToken() return value. Or, if the
**   input buffer is exhausted, xTokenize() should return SQLITE_OK. Finally,
**   if an error occurs with the xTokenize() implementation itself, it
**   may abandon the tokenization and return any error code other than
**   SQLITE_OK or SQLITE_DONE.
**
**   If the tokenizer is registered using an fts5_tokenizer_v2 object,
**   then the xTokenize() method has two additional arguments - pLocale
**   and nLocale. These specify the locale that the tokenizer should use
**   for the current request. If pLocale and nLocale are both 0, then the
**   tokenizer should use its default locale. Otherwise, pLocale points to
**   an nLocale byte buffer containing the name of the locale to use as utf-8
**   text. pLocale is not nul-terminated.
**
** FTS5_TOKENIZER
**
** There is also an fts5_tokenizer object. This is an older, deprecated,
** version of fts5_tokenizer_v2. It is similar except that:
**
**  <ul>
**    <li> There is no "iVersion" field, and
**    <li> The xTokenize() method does not take a locale argument.
**  </ul>
**
** Legacy fts5_tokenizer tokenizers must be registered using the
** legacy xCreateTokenizer() function, instead of xCreateTokenizer_v2().
**
** Tokenizer implementations registered using either API may be retrieved
** using both xFindTokenizer() and xFindTokenizer_v2().
**
** SYNONYM SUPPORT
**
**   Custom tokenizers may also support synonyms. Consider a case in which a
**   user wishes to query for a phrase such as "first place". Using the
**   built-in tokenizers, the FTS5 query 'first + place' will match instances
**   of "first place" within the document set, but not alternative forms
**   such as "1st place". In some applications, it would be better to match
**   all instances of "first place" or "1st place" regardless of which form
**   the user specified in the MATCH query text.
**
**   There are several ways to approach this in FTS5:
**
**   <ol><li> By mapping all synonyms to a single token. In this case, using
**            the above example, this means that the tokenizer returns the
**            same token for inputs "first" and "1st". Say that token is in
**            fact "first", so that when the user inserts the document "I won
**            1st place" entries are added to the index for tokens "i", "won",
**            "first" and "place". If the user then queries for '1st + place',
**            the tokenizer substitutes "first" for "1st" and the query works
**            as expected.
**
**       <li> By querying the index for all synonyms of each query term
**            separately. In this case, when tokenizing query text, the
**            tokenizer may provide multiple synonyms for a single term
**            within the document. FTS5 then queries the index for each
**            synonym individually. For example, faced with the query:
**
**   <codeblock>
**     ... MATCH 'first place'</codeblock>
**
**            the tokenizer offers both "1st" and "first" as synonyms for the
**            first token in the MATCH query and FTS5 effectively runs a query
**            similar to:
**
**   <codeblock>
**     ... MATCH '(first OR 1st) place'</codeblock>
**
**            except that, for the purposes of auxiliary functions, the query
**            still appears to contain just two phrases - "(first OR 1st)"
**            being treated as a single phrase.
**
**       <li> By adding multiple synonyms for a single term to the FTS index.
**            Using this method, when tokenizing document text, the tokenizer
**            provides multiple synonyms for each token. So that when a
**            document such as "I won first place" is tokenized, entries are
**            added to the FTS index for "i", "won", "first", "1st" and
**            "place".
**
**            This way, even if the tokenizer does not provide synonyms
**            when tokenizing query text (it should not - to do so would be
**            inefficient), it doesn't matter if the user queries for
**            'first + place' or '1st + place', as there are entries in the
**            FTS index corresponding to both forms of the first token.
**   </ol>
**
**   Whether it is parsing document or query text, any call to xToken that
**   specifies a <i>tflags</i> argument with the FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED bit
**   is considered to supply a synonym for the previous token. For example,
**   when parsing the document "I won first place", a tokenizer that supports
**   synonyms would call xToken() 5 times, as follows:
**
**   <codeblock>
**       xToken(pCtx, 0, "i",                      1,  0,  1);
**       xToken(pCtx, 0, "won",                    3,  2,  5);
**       xToken(pCtx, 0, "first",                  5,  6, 11);
**       xToken(pCtx, FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED, "1st", 3,  6, 11);
**       xToken(pCtx, 0, "place",                  5, 12, 17);
**</codeblock>
**
**   It is an error to specify the FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED flag the first time
**   xToken() is called. Multiple synonyms may be specified for a single token
**   by making multiple calls to xToken(FTS5_TOKEN_COLOCATED) in sequence.
**   There is no limit to the number of synonyms that may be provided for a
**   single token.
**
**   In many cases, method (1) above is the best approach. It does not add
**   extra data to the FTS index or require FTS5 to query for multiple terms,
**   so it is efficient in terms of disk space and query speed. However, it
**   does not support prefix queries very well. If, as suggested above, the
**   token "first" is substituted for "1st" by the tokenizer, then the query:
**
**   <codeblock>
**     ... MATCH '1s*'</codeblock>
**
**   will not match documents that contain the token "1st" (as the tokenizer
**   will probably not map "1s" to any prefix of "first").
**
**   For full prefix support, method (3) may be preferred. In this case,
**   because the index contains entries for both "first" and "1st", prefix
**   queries such as 'fi*' or '1s*' will match correctly. However, because
**   extra entries are added to the FTS index, this method uses more space
**   within the database.
**
**   Method (2) offers a midpoint between (1) and (3). Using this method,
**   a query such as '1s*' will match documents that contain the literal
**   token "1st", but not "first" (assuming the tokenizer is not able to
**   provide synonyms for prefixes). However, a non-prefix query like '1st'
**   will match against "1st" and "first". This method does not require
**   extra disk space, as no extra entries are added to the FTS index.
**   On the other hand, it may require more CPU cycles to run MATCH queries,
**   as separate queries of the FTS index are required for each synonym.
**
**   When using methods (2) or (3), it is important that the tokenizer only
**   provide synonyms when tokenizing document text (method (3)) or query
**   text (method (2)), not both. Doing so will not cause any errors, but is
**   inefficient.

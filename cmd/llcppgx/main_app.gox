llcppgx aims to be a tool for automatically generating LLGo bindings for C/C++ libraries.

In order to convert C/C++ library to go package, you should do the steps as follows:

1、llcppgx init <libname>
For example, run 'llcppgx init libcjson', it will init llcppg.cfg for libcjson library.
In order to successfully convert the C/C++ library, you should carefully inspect and edit llcppg.cfg.

2、llcppgx gensym
It will generate and edits the symbol table for the libcjson library.

3、llcppgx genpkg -mod "github.com/goplus/cjson"
It will generate a go package for the libcjson library.
